**STEP 1 :** Select a plaintext to be encrypted.

**STEP 2 :** Select 'l' such that l < (length of plaintext)/2.

**STEP 3 :** Select an Initialization Vector, IV of length l.

**STEP 4 :** Get the value of F(x) by providing a string of length l in the field titled 'Your text' and clicking on 'Apply Function'. Repeat this for as many times as you need to get the encrypted text for the plaintext selected in Step 1. You can change the function if you wish to.

**STEP 5 :** Write the final cipher text in 'Final Output' field.

**STEP 6 :** Once you have learnt to work with the basic CBC-MAC, you can make it secure either by prepending the message length or by using multiple keys (as described in the theory section). You may accordingly work with the second part of the experiment (this is very similar to the first part and hence your answer in not checked)
