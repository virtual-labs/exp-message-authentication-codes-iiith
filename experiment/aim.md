A Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC), is a technique for constructing a message authentication code from a block cipher.

**About the experiment:**

In the experiment we provide a "dummy" block cipher (that is just a function and has none of the properties of a real block cipher) and ask you to use it to compute the CBC_MAC tag of an arbitrary message
